# unnamed flying game
A top city shooter we made to be used at a unity gathering, never happened.


         
This game was made by Pastille AB a game studio somewhere between the year 2015 and early 2019. We are clowing down the company for good and did not want to split the IP between the companies that owned Pastille. 

We thought it was a much better idea to put the graphics, the audio and the source for everyone to use.

You are welcome.

We bought some assets to get the games to run, so these have been removed from the repo. The game will not start in Unity directly, you need to do some tweaking and get those assets in place or replace them with something else. The .gitignore should be very helful in this.
